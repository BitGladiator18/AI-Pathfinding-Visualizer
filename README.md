# 🧠 AI Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive desktop application that visualizes classic pathfinding algorithms on a dynamic grid using Python and Pygame. Built as a personal project to strengthen concepts in data structures, algorithms, and GUI programming.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visualize popular algorithms: **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A\***
- Click-based interface to set start/end nodes and barriers
- Real-time animation of the pathfinding process
- UI panel with dropdown for algorithm selection and speed control
- Pause/resume support for better observation
- Grid overlays and color-coded node states (open, closed, path)

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- **A\*** with Manhattan, Euclidean, and Chebyshev heuristics
